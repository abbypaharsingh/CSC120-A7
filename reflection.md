Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

Which methods did you decide to overload, and why?
House.java - In this class I decided to overload the goUp and goDown methods. I wanted users to have the option to not enter a number if they only need to go up by one floor. 

Cafe.java - In this class I overloaded many things. I overloaded the constructor to allow users to create a cafe without inputting whether it has an elevator or not. I did this since it is a pretty unlikely scenario considering that most cafes have one floor or maximum two.

I also overloaded the sellCoffee method to account for a variation in data types. In the case that someone only wants 1.5 packets of sugar in their coffee, or 16.5 ounces of coffee, or 2.5 creams. 

I also overloaded the goUp and goDown methods.

Library.java- In this class, I overloaded the isAvailable method, to figure out if a book is available by its ISBN. In order to get this function to work though I had to create another hashtable that matches ISBN with book title, and adding an addISBN method. 

I also overloaded the goUp and goDown methods.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The ambiguity issue was an annoying error to figure out when overloading methods. Apparently type double covers what would be included in type int but not the other way around.
